            This was the final project that I did at Skill Distillery and it was
            a group project where I worked with 3 other people. It was my first
            time making an application using Angular and it was a fun learning
            experience.

            SkillSwap is an application where one can post about DIY projects
            that they are doing, or want to do, to get help from others. You are
            able to create a project, delete your own project, join a project,
            and comment on projects.
          </li>

            On this project I was able to work a lot more on the backend to get
            a further understanding of the mapping that needs to be done for the
            application to work best.
          </li>

            This project was really fun to work on the different CSS elements
            that we added. I really enjoyed working on the profile information
            page where you can edit your information.
